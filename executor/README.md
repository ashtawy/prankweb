# About
This module wrap _p2rank_ together with other tools, like conservation pipeline,
necessary to execute task for _prankweb_.

# Changes
p2rank does not support redirects of 
[stderr to custom file](https://github.com/rdk/p2rank/issues/39)
we have custom scripts to run p2rank as a workaround.

We also increase the default memory limit to 4GB.
