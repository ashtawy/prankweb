# About

You can [run p2rank on your computer using Docker](https://github.com/cusbg/p2rank-framework/wiki/P2Rank-Deploy-Docker) that way you have access to the same functionality as prankweb.
Alternatively, you can run [p2rank without Docker](https://github.com/rdk/p2rank#setup) but then some features, like conservation, are not available.  

More information about [p2rank] and prankweb can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/cusbg/p2rank-framework/wiki).
